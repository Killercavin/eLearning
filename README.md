## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a webserver installed in your computer. I recommend using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) for this purpose. Xampp is available for all platforms and or environments from Windows, MacOS to Linux.

You can also use [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) if using WindowsOS or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) if you are using macOS or [LAMP](https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer) if using LinuxOS for this purpose.

You can also use any other webserver of your choice.

Install your favourite server ie Xampp etc

If on Xampp the you will clone the project on a folder/ directory named ./htdocs in the xampp directory... Please check for the official documentation for all the setups and guide on [XAMPP](https://apachefriends.org) 


If on WAMP, MAMP or LAMP the you will clone the project on a folder/ directory named ./www in the xampp directory... Please check for the official documentation for all the setups and guide on their respective dormains
